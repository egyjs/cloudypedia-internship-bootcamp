This repo is maintained by the interns to help us:
- 📘 Document **summaries** for each day’s modules (everyone can share their own)
- 🧠 Share personal **notes** when someone understands critical details or gains hands-on experience with a concept
- 🌐 Contribute **external resources** (articles, videos, blogs, docs) related to any of the day’s modules via the `readinglist.md` file

The goal is to build a **collaborative, structured, and reusable reference** that helps us:
- Learn from each other’s perspectives
- Revise quickly before assessments or certification
- Develop strong documentation and cloud learning habits

> If you're an intern in this bootcamp, this is your space to **contribute, collaborate, and grow together** 🚀

## 🌐 Reading List Contribution Guide

Each `day-XX/readinglist.md` file is a shared space where interns can add **external resources** that help explain or deepen the concepts covered on that day.

This may include:
- Blog posts and articles
- YouTube videos and tutorials
- Google Cloud documentation
- Visual aids or cheat sheets

---

### ✍️ How to Add a Resource

1. Open the file:  
   `day-XX/readinglist.md`

2. Add your link in this format:

```md
- [Resource Title](https://link.com) – *shared by Mohamed*
````

✅ **Example:**

```md
- [Intro to GCP – Visual Guide](https://example.com/gcp) – *shared by Mohamed*

> Add your links under the single list for the day—**no need to group by module, or just mention that this concept is related to module-x..**
